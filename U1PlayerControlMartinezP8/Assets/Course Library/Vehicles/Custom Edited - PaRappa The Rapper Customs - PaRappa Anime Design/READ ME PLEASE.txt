PaRappa, but modeled after his anime design.
As you can probably see, I've evolved a lot with my modeling skills.
This model was made from scratch by me, using Blender 2.79. I mainly
just use subdivided squares, and continue to extrude & merge them
around. I surely do much more than that, but I'm not here to tutor
people on modeling like me.
